                  <p class="leading">There is one simple way through which movie buffs can actually save their
                        money.From our movie review site,
                        movie buffs come to know people's opinions about a particular movie. On the basis of the
                        review a movie buff
                        can take his decision (whether to watch it in the theater or categorize it as a flop
                        movie).</p>
                  <p style="line-height: 1.5">Television commercials on new releases are enough to entice
                        millions of movie lovers who run off to the movie theatres to watch those movies. These
                        movie commercials are created to hoodwink the audience. A commercial tends to show that
                        a movie is simply amazing, whereas when a movie buff actually sees it, he finds it to be
                        a complete flop picture.
                        Just by watching these commercials, movie buffs run to theaters and waste their money to
                        watch flop films
                        that do not even stay in the theaters for a week. .</p>
